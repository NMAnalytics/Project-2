#  Data Analyst Project 2

In this project, I will be analyzing sample sales data.  I will be using SQL to find trends and uncover insights from customers' previous purchases. The sales data shows the purchases of toys from different companies. The data includes price, number of orders, order date, and other important information. The toys were categorized as Motorcycles, Classic Cars, Trucks and Buses, Vintage Cars, Planes, and Ships.



Questions that I will be answering are 

1. What are the highest selling products?
2. What is the highest selling year?
3. What is the highest-selling month?
4. What products sold the most in the month? 
5. What is the deal size for sales?
6. Who are our best customers?
7. What products are bought together?
